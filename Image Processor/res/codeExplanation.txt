Due to the fact that the buttons in the GUI do not work, I focused on implementing the mosaicking
method for the text-based inputs. However, due to the way that the controller is set up, there is no
way to seperate running the text-based scripting from the GUI inputs. Therefore, I am unable to run my
mosaicking method on the command line. I have asked my partners to fix their code in a way which
allows me to run the text-based inputs. However, I have received no response and have attached a
screenshot within this res folder of my sent email. I have implemented the mosaicking method in a
way which should work when run on the command line if the controller is fixed. The assignment
indicates that we are not responsible for fixing their code, so I did not and implemented my method
accordingly. I have also written tests which pass and show that the mosaicking method is working
properly.
